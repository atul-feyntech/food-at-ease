## Launch Campaign

### Launch Tweet/Post #1 - Announcement
```
⚖️ Introducing FOODATEASE

Ab tolo, phir khao.

We rated 5,000+ Indian packaged foods based on what's ACTUALLY in them.

No marketing fluff. No paid rankings. Just FSSAI data + brutal honesty.

Your Maggi? 2 stars. Your "health drink"? Probably worse.

### Launch Tweet #2 - Problem Statement
```
🇮🇳 India's packaged food problem:

• 73% of Indians are protein deficient
• 57% of women have anemia
• 89 million have diabetes

And we're eating "healthy" snacks loaded with sodium and sugar.

Time to see the truth.

Bournvita says: "Tayyari jeet ki" 💪

FoodAtEase says:
- 37g sugar per 100g
- That's 7+ teaspoons per serving
- Same as eating chocolate

Our rating: ⭐⭐ (2/5)
